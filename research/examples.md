### Hello Stranger

Posted by @yifeng

Hello Stranger was an interactive installation consisting of a field of 30 LED pillars arranged in a field and embedded in gravel. Each pillar is 3m tall and has 12 individually addressable RGB elements. Together they form a sparse 3D display which is immersive (you can walk through it), tangible (you can touch it) and real (as opposed to virtual). It was exhibited during the 2005 Science et Cite festival in Zurich. A non-interactive version was shown at the the 2006 Les yeux de la nuit exhibition in Geneva.

The interactions:
Heart - the beating red heart at the centre of the space speeds up as you approach it
Rain - it always rains red on you
Fire - release fireballs from the gravel as you walk
Cortex - simple 3D walk-through model of activation between and across layers of cortex
Flower - flowers open as you walk through the gravel
Tornado - swirling lights follow you around
Spectrum (not interactive) - possibly the world's biggest Hi-Fi spectrum analyser

### Communicative Display Skin for the Hunsthaus Graz

Posted by @yifeng

The idea of the media installation BIX arose out of considerations on how to equip the interior of the Kunsthaus in Graz with media (≥KMA). BIX was created as an additional feature at a time when overall planning of the Kunsthaus had already reached an advanced stage.Constructed from about 1,300 individually shaped, translucent Plexiglas panels covering the biomorphic building, the so-called skin was intended to feature different nuances of transparency, which would have created varying communicative relationships between interior and exterior.

### In Order to Control | Interactive Installation

by @yifeng

It’s one thing to stand in font of a projector to create shadow puppets, but it’s an entirely different experience to block a text-based floor projection and see your typographic silhouette on an adjacent wall. Istanbul-based multidisciplinary creative studio NOTA BENE Visual has designed a mind-boggling audiovisual installation using an intricately executed video-mapping technique that uses the latest technology to create an artistically intriguing environment for spectators to engage in.

### SFMOMA: LED Lights Transform into 3D Screen

Posted by @yifeng

Artist Jim Campbell just recently debuted "Exploded Views," a random cascade of flickering LED lights...or so you think. Make it up to the 2nd floor landing and watch the lights transform into a 3D screen where human figures magically come to life!
Part sculpture, part cinematic screen, the grid is composed of thousands of computer-controlled LED spheres that create the illusion of fleeting shadow-like figures.

### Lunar Trails

Posted by @jstoddart

_Lunar Trails_ was a project by artist, [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://seb.ly/), for the _GAME_ exhibition at the Dublin Science Gallery. The project used a vintage arcade game, Lunar Lander, and linked the player's actions on screen to a wall-drawing robot. The robot would inscribe each player's trajectory on the wall-mounted canvas, producing a layering of multiple attempt (and successes and failures) at landing their lunar lander.

### Blur: braincoats

Posted by @jstoddart

The _Braincoat_ was smart raincoat created for [Diller Scofidio's](http://dsrny.com/) Blur Building for the Swiss Expo in 2002, but was ultimately unrealized in the final project. With their sensory experience impaired by the pavilion's fog generators, the _braincoat _acted as a proximity-based social surrogate, using sensors and logic to instigate interaction. Prior to entering the pavilion, users were asked to fill out a questionnaire. Once inside the pavilion, the coats would illuminate and vibrate to identify levels of compatibility with other nearby visitors, with "emotional responses" ranging from affinity to antipathy.

### Hektor

Posted by @jstoddart

[Hektor](http://hektor.ch/) is "a portable Spray-paint Output Device for laptop computers" created by Jürg Lehni in 2002. The system runs on a custom-build signal processor to interpret and translate vector drawings (via Adobe Illustrator scripting) into the physical realm. Hektor is at it's core a vertical CNC drawing machine using a custom-built platorm to hold and operate the spray can and suspended from two stepper motors via a cables. It uses the messiness of the medium (spray paint) to generate work that eschews the precision typically produced through the CNC process. The platform was designed to be mobile, and has been exhibited in multiple settings include museum shows where it produces work in collaboration created by a guest artist.

###Rain Room

Posted by @jstoddart

The Rain Room is an installation piece by the artist collective [rAndom International](http://random-international.com/) originally displayed in 2012 in London, and most recently shown in 2013 at [MOMA](http://www.momaps1.org/expo1/module/rainroom/). The installation employed a sprinkler system connected to a sensor array via solenoid valves. The sensors would detect motion and proximity of viewers and shut off the water supply above their location, allowing them to pass through the rain without getting wet.

### Daniel Rozin - Mechanical Mirror series

Posted by @jstoddart

Artist [Daniel Rozin](http://www.smoothware.com/danny) has created a series of analog mirror projects that translate an image of the viewer, to a representation via mechanical movement of physical "pixels". The input camera is either located within or near the piece, and a computer processes the image to translate values of light & dark. An array of servos then translate this brightness value to physical movement, reorienting the pixels. The material for the pixels changes from project to project along with the mechanism for reflecting the brightness values. In some works, the pixels have material orientations (via tilting in the [Trash Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/newtrashmirror.html) or surface texture in the [Brushed Metal Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/brushedmetalmirror.html)), so rotations change the quality of the reflected light. In others (such as the [Circles Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/circlesmirror.html) and the [Weave Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/weavemirror.html)), the pixels have a gradient value and rotation reveals a lighter or darker value.
