### Experiments in Motion expected structure, April 2011

![EIM proposed structure](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/EIM_proposed_structure.png)


### The problem with think tanks: they've become ubiquitous

![Google nGram Think Tank](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/google_nGram_thinkTank.png)


### Pretending we know what a design studio is, we can focus on the bookends of the program, comparing Think Tank and Incubator to attempt to sharpen our understanding of each type

![Think Tank to Incubator](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/EIM_thinktank-incubator_iso.png)


## Think Tank Archetype


### The first "think tank": Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1954)

![OED Think Tank](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/OED_thinkTank.jpg)

### What were the typological attributes of the first think tank?


## Preparing the Ground

### In 1947, Henry Ford dies and leaves much of his fortune to the Ford Foundation

*	![Henry Ford Funeral in LIFE](http://books.google.com.br/books?id=ck0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&img=1&zoom=3&hl=pt-BR&sig=ACfU3U2AFnSn1CjAvrVcgZpgR8_UC0nW2w&w=685&w=800)


### In 1949, the Ford Foundation board of trustees select Horace Rowan Gaither, RAND co-founder and future director, to report on what the now most well endowed foundation in the world should do

>	“Established for the General purpose of advancing human welfare”

*	![Gaither Report cover](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_report_1_cover.jpg)
*	![Gaither report inside](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_report_2.jpg)
*	![Gaither report contents](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_report_3_index.jpg)


### Program Area Five - Individual Behavior and Human Relations - coined the term "Behavioral Science" and set up the meta-design for the first think tank:

![Gaither report snippet](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_snippet_1.jpg)

Knowledge production


![Gaither report snippet](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_snippet_2.jpg)

Free of university and market pressures - basic research


![Gaither report snippet](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_snippet_3.jpg)

Bolster international relations with non-communist world


![Gaither report snippet](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_snippet_4.jpg)

Prepare young scholars


![Gaither report snippet](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/gaither_snippet_5.jpg)

Promote and provide interdisciplinary interaction




## Characteristics of the Think Tank Archetype

>	Maximize

Disciplines, scholars, knowledge, American influence

>	Insure

The production of _original_ ideas, new branches of knowledge

>	Free

A "socio-cultural milieu" of free intellectual exchange




## Architecture of the Think Tank Archetype

### A free atmosphere of communication and exchange

![CASBS Site Plan](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/casbs_sitePlan.jpg)

_Arts and Architecture_, February 1955


### Welcome to California

![CASBS Photo grounds](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/casbs_photo_grounds.jpg)

### The school of Palo Alto

*	![School of Athens](http://uploads5.wikipaintings.org/images/raphael/school-of-athens-detail-from-right-hand-side-showing-diogenes-on-the-steps-and-euclid-1511.jpg)


>	“Individual studies, conference rooms, and research facilities have been designed without disturbing accents and to provide the necessary privacy, both material and psychological, needed to carry on the objectives of the project.”  
	__-Arts and Architecture, February 1955__

*	![CASBS Lobby](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/casbs_photo_interiorLobby.jpg)
*	![CASBS Table](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/casbs_photo_interiorTable.jpg)


>	"It is precisely the unprogrammed, the unforced, uncoercive atmosphere of the Center which makes it so remarkable. It is not a planning institution but a scanning institution, and it has, I think, succeeded in introducing a much needed element of playfulness into American academic life. It is precisely that element which produces new and unforeseen combinations and which is most likely to speed up the rate of intellectual mutation."  
	__-Kenneth E. Boulden, CASBS fellow, 1954__


![CASBS Interiors](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/casbs_photo_interiors.jpg)


>	“This book is the result of a unique experience and a unique institution... described by a perceptive Catholic priest as a retreat house for the intellect. Eleven months of vigorous interaction, both playful and serious, with a group of thirty-six able social and biological scientists produced in me a state of mind in which the following monograph was written, or rather dictated, in uninterrupted composition.”  
	__-Kenneth E. Boulden, preface to “The Image: Knowledge in Life and Socieity”, a book dictated in 11 days at the CASBS in 1954__



## Incubator Fever

### In 2011, it seemed a new incubator was opening every day, if not faster

*	![Incubator fever](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/incubator_fever_6.jpg)


### It hasn't seemed to wane in enthusiasm in late 2013

![1000startups, September 25, 2013](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/130926_incubator_fever_continues.png)

## Incubator investment model

### The financial ethos of the incubator is a combination of the mechanics of venture capital and the theory of disruptive innovation

![Investment model 1](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/investmentModel_1.png)

### The combination of placing many bets and potentially winning big shape the incubator type

![Investment model 2](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/investmentModel_2.png)




## Incubator Archetype

### In 1995, Paul Graham and others started investing in start up companies in Boston.

![Paul Graham and Ashton Kutcher](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00434/114681673_a_434126c.jpg)

### In 2005, they moved to San Francisco and opened Y Combinator, an incubation space for tech companies that offered small seed investments and mentoring to an inaugural class of 8 companies in exchange for equity

*	![Y Combinator logo](http://ycombinator.com/images/yc500.gif)

### As of 2012, they have crystalized their model into a highly structured environment for producing disruptive innovation, and grown their class to 66 in 2012

![Y Combinator timeline](https://raw.github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/master/images/research/thinktankhistory/ycombinator_timeline.png)

*	![Y Combinator Image](http://ycombinator.com/slideshow/7.jpg)




## Characteristics of the Incubator Archetype

>	Minimize

Isolate a minimum viable product that can ignite a business

>	Insure

The production of _disruptive_ ideas, toppling existing industry leaders

>	Direct

Young founders' ideas with proven formulas


## Archetype Comparison

### Similarities between think tank and incubator types

1.	Extra-University
2.	Production of innovations
3.	Convert uncertainty into risk
4.	Foster young talent

### Differences between think tank and incubator types

## From Office to University





### Chris Leong invited me to speak at the AIA on Think Tanks in April 2011

## Retrospective Update

### We actually ended up making an office rather than an incubator

### in order to produce an exhibition.

### The NYC-based model we looked at in 2011 was General Assembly, which presented itself as an incubator and co-work space.


### Today, General Assembly has redefined itself as a school.


### This was always their ambition, but they decided to drop the office aspects.

>	“We wanted to recreate the feeling of a college campus, ” said Adam Pritzker, one of the creators of [General Assembly]. “Something that was outside the structure of an institution but had the same academic tendencies.”
	- [New York Times, January 24, 2011](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/a-place-for-techies-to-gather/)



## From School to Office

>	"Architecture is a collaborative art, perhaps the most collaborative of all. No architect is ever alone. No studio is ever isolated."
	- Mark Wigley, "The Open-Sourced Architect"

### Our course, Site to Site, has decided to work as an office, using the open source platform Github to structure our collaboration inside the class and with outsiders.
