##	Program/App Name

I propose a device that would start out in one location and can later be implemented in other. At that point the locations will become interactive and integrated.


## Scenario

This device would be able to control lights, moisture, conditioner, heat, it would also control sound and video. In a way I imagine a “smart house” without the stack of servers if that is possible. This device would allow for these things to be controlled by apps of programs as well as sensors such as: if you turn on the projector, the lights go off. If you have a screening, the other studio X location will display it automatically. When the first person enters a room, the coffee machine starts. There would be sensors that can read moisture, temperature and light.

## Critique

A classmate or instructor will add their notes here. For example:

Lorem ipsum you should check out [Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's](http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/) work, it's all about orchestration and shared experiences. Lorem ipsum, ipsum lorem.
