##	Global X

I propose a device that would start out in one location and can later be implemented in other. At that point the locations will become interactive and integrated.


## Scenario

When the first person enters a room, the coffee machine starts.

## Narrative

The door will have a motion sensor that will be able to tell if someone enters the room. If there is no one in the room the sensor will send a signal to the coffee machine and the coffee will start. Entering a room is an important part of experienceing an architectural space. Coffee in a studio X location is the fuel that runds the creative group.

## Objects

The scenario needs a person, a door, a motion sensor and a coffee machine.

## Critique

A classmate or instructor will add their notes here. For example:

Lorem ipsum you should check out [Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's](http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/) work, it's all about orchestration and shared experiences. Lorem ipsum, ipsum lorem.
