##	Program/App Name

Hot Spot identifies areas of greatest activity (and heat) to direct air flow and maintain a comfortable working environment.

## Scenario

 Infrared sensors, located either in the periphery or embedded in furniture, monitor the room for hot spots.

 The temperature gradient is processed by the micro-controller, and when temperatures reach uncomfortable levels, signals are sent to four stepper motors, each connected by cable to a corner of a suspended box fan. Through coordinated motion, the stepper motors reel in/out the cables to tilt the fans, directing the airflow for maximum cooling potential.

 This setup can be employed solo or in an array formation, to maintain comfort, civility, and productivity.
