##	Interactive_exhibition/e_X_hibit

A motion-sensory system that reads visitor movement in front of display areas and interact with the viewer using the speed of the displaying content. 

## Scenario

video analysor/sensors are installed in front of the displaying surface/screen, as the viewer comes into the proximity of the appropriate displaying area:
a. Slides will apear and animate accroding to the relative positioning of the viewer to a desinated viewing area. The animation will synch up with the view's motion, and pace the itself to fit itself accroding to the relative location within the viewing area. When viewer stops, images freeze its animation, when viewer moves, the images moves with him/her. 
b. If the medium is video. It treats itself as the length of the slide show, and its speed will be determined by the viewer's speed of movement across the viewing area.
