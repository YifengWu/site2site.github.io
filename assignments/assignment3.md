## Pitch

Next week, Sept 26 at Studio-X NYC, each group will pitch __two directions__ to a set of critic-clients: Nicola Twilley, Carlos Solis, Benedict Clouette, Marina Otero and Janette Kim. You will _not_ produce a PDF or Powerpoint, but rather use Github to present in the same format as the course [lectures](http://site2site.github.io/lectures/week1/attitude.html). Follow __all__ of the instructions below carefully and __please note__ the due date and mandatory office hours below.

Please also __follow the conventions__ of the presentation [template](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/blob/master/projects/presentation_template.md), which you can see rendered [here](http://site2site.github.io/projects/presentation_template.html).


### Presentations

Each group will have 5 minutes total to present __two separate__ directions of different installation strategies.

First, you will present a one paragraph brief: a polemic/argument/contextualization to describe your position and put your proposal in context. You should consider how you wish to affect architecture practice and why; how your proposal fits into contemporary discourse in architecture, technology and any other domains you wish to address (such as the political, social, economic, environmental, etc.); and what the stakes are for this new kind of space and practice.

You will then present __two separate__ strategies (in the same presentation file) to address the brief you have given yourselves. __Each__ strategy __must__ include at minimum (though feel free to add more):

*	project title
*	one sentence description
*	paragraph description
*	one or more floor plans to show the key elements and how they interact
*	2 collages or renderings to illustrate key moments in the experience
*	diagram of how your objects will connect
*	images of each of the objects you will use showing how you plan to integrate the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors, actuators, wiring and any other technical elements (can be custom drawings, collages with photos from the internet, or whatever best describes the object and how you will wire it up)
*	one or two images or videos from 2-3 reference projects that you are drawing inspiration from
*	inventory of parts (a simple list in text is fine)

You don't need to follow the order above for your presentation, you just need to make sure all of the elements are represented.


### Process

You've all just been added to teams in Github corresponding to the project teams decided last night. You've also been given admin access to a new repository corresponding to your team. You need to do the following:

1.	Rename this repository with the name of your project by going to `settings` and making the change - you can change this later
2.	Edit the one sentence description at the top of the page by clicking the grey Edit button
3.	Update the README.md file to include your one paragraph brief (see Presentation section above)
4.	Add a new file at the top level called `presentation.md` to put your entire presentation as per the Presentation section above. You can work on the file collaboratively, and we will be checking to make sure each team member has committed something. See the presentation [template](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/blob/master/projects/presentation_template.md) for conventions to follow.

__Note__: Each member of your group will be editing the same files, so be sure to commit and sync __very regularly__ (each time you make a small small small change), and to click sync on your local Github client before you begin to edit any files on your local computer, so you will not over-write your team members contributions.


## Due Date and Mandatory Office Hours

The above is due at 9am on Tuesday, Sept 24. Please sign up for a meeting with Troy on the [Wiki Office Hours](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Office-Hours) page to discuss. All elements above must be ready by 9am on Tuesday so we can begin to spec out potential avenues for implementation and iron out any issues before the presentation on Thursday, Sept 26 at Studio-X.
