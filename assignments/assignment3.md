## Pitch

Next week, Sept 26 at Studio-X NYC, each group will pitch __two directions__ to a set of critic-clients: Nicola Twilley, Carlos Solis, Benedict Clouette, Marina Otero and Janette Kim. You will _not_ produce a PDF or Powerpoint, but rather use Github to present in the same format as the course [lectures](http://site2site.github.io/lectures/week1/attitude.html). Follow the conventions of the presentation [template](), which you can see rendered [here](http://site2site.github.io/projects/presentation_template.html).

### Requirements

Each group will have 5 minutes total to present from the course website


Be sure to include for _both_:

* Develop a one paragraph polemic describing your position of your two proposals. What is their relevance to architecture? What are the stakes for this new kind of space?
*	project title
*	one sentence description
*	paragraph description
*	floor plan
*	2 collages / renderings
*	diagram of objects connecting
*	three reference projects
*	inventory of parts



## Mandatory Office Hours
