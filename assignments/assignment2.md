## Deadlines and Overview

All research should be done by Tuesday night of this coming week. On Thursday we've invited Julia Kaganksiy, Editor at Large of the [Creators Project](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/en_us), to come to class to discuss your ideas and give a short presentation on digital art and physical installations. This week is the time to come up with as many ideas and resources for the class as possible - new projects are getting published everyday, so this repository will certainly keep growing all semester. It is also the week to take what you've learned so far and update your thinking about a program/app, and to build your foundation in Javascript.


## Code Academy

Please finish the Javascript tutorial at [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) if you haven't already. On average, the class has finished about 12% so far.


## Research

We would like everyone to begin creating a body of research for the entire class to share on GitHub.

Please research at least 5 examples of projects that exhibit a connection between digital and physical spaces. Examples can be from architecture, art, design, fashion and beyond. In a short paragraph please describe the details of each example. Also include location, date, designer, sensors used, and technology used. 

Please put these up on the GitHub wiki [Research Page](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Research) (following the template therein as a minimum, and adding more when possible) so that everyone in the class can share resources and examples. Post at least two images for each example as well as links to more information. Please take a look at the proposals of your classmates from last week and let them know if you find relevant information.


## Program/App 1.0

Following the lecture and the workshop with @rwaldron last week, you may have a better understanding of where this class is going and what's possible with the technology and what others have done with it.

Using the list of programs/apps [here](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/tree/master/programs) as a place of inspiration, you will create a local respository in _your own_ Github account that will describe a program/app that you will present to the class next week. This can be a continuation of your previous program/app, a continuation of someone else's program/app, a mashup of two or more ideas, or something entirely new.

This new program/app should focus on Studio-X NYC, but can connect to the outside world through the web and social media and to other spaces in the Studio-X Global Network. 

You can give the program/app a new name, or use an existing name if it best represents your idea for the program/app. Be sure to _avoid_ anything but alphanumeric characters - i.e. please don't put parentheses, etc, in the title, as this will cause many problems.

Describe your program/app scenario in a README.md file at the top level of your repository, and put all images in a directory called `images` that you will need to put inside of another directory called `docs` - i.e. put images inside of `/docs/images`.
