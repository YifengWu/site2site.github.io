## Deadlines and Overview

All research should be done by Tuesday night of this coming week. On Thursday we've invited Julia Kaganksiy, Editor at Large of the [Creators Project](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/en_us), to come to class to discuss your ideas and give a short presentation on digital art and physical installations. This week is the time to come up with as many ideas and resources for the class as possible - new projects are getting published everyday, so this repository will certainly keep growing all semester. It is also the week to take what you've learned so far and update your thinking about a program/app, and to build your foundation in Javascript.


## Code Academy

Please finish the Javascript tutorial at [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) if you haven't already. On average, the class has finished about 12% so far.


## Research

We would like everyone to begin creating a body of research for the entire class to share on GitHub.

Please research at least 5 examples of projects that exhibit a connection between digital and physical spaces. Examples can be from architecture, art, design, fashion and beyond. In a short paragraph please describe the details of each example. Also include location, date, designer, sensors used, and technology used. 

Please put these up on the GitHub wiki [Research Page](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Research) (following the template therein as a minimum, and adding more when possible) so that everyone in the class can share resources and examples. Post at least two images for each example as well as links to more information. Please take a look at the proposals of your classmates from last week and let them know if you find relevant information.


## Program/App 1.0

Following the lecture and the workshop with @rwaldron last week, you may have a better understanding of where this class is going and what's possible with the technology and what others have done with it.

Using the list of programs/apps [here](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/tree/master/programs) as a place of inspiration, you will create a local respository in _your own_ Github account that will describe a program/app that you will present to the class next week. This can be a continuation of your previous program/app, a continuation of someone else's program/app, a mashup of two or more ideas, or something entirely new.

This new program/app should focus on Studio-X NYC, but can connect to the outside world through the web and social media and to other spaces in the Studio-X Global Network. 

You can give the program/app a new name, or use an existing name if it best represents your idea for the program/app. Be sure to _avoid_ anything but alphanumeric characters - i.e. please don't put parentheses, etc, in the title, as this will cause many problems.

Describe your program/app scenario in a README.md file at the top level of your repository, and put all images in a directory called `images` that you will need to put inside of another directory called `docs` - i.e. put images inside of `/docs/images`.










Sign up for each service listed on the course wiki [Services](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Services) page, if you don't already have an account. Send an email to [Troy](mailto:tct2003@columbia.edu) with your Github username once you have it and wait for him to respond that you have been added to the Site2Site organization.

Add your profile, including your usernames with links to each of the above services, to the course wiki [Class Directory](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Class-Directory) page, following the example of Jim.


## Software Install

If you have access to your own computer, install the software on the wiki [Software](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Software) page.


## Programs/Apps

Each student will propose _either_ one local program/app for Studio-X NYC _or_ one global program/app to connect two or more spaces across the Studio-X Global Network.

To begin, log in to your Github account then go to the [site2site.github.io](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io) repository and click the fork button on the top right.

If you are using the browser-based workflow, go to the `programs/boilerplate` directory and open the `scenario.md` file. Select all the text inside and copy it. Then, go up a level to the `programs` directory and lick the file add button. In the input field that appears, type the name of your program/app (use dashes to link multiple words, rather than spaces) followed by a slash (/) and then the name `scenario.md`. Then paste in the text you just copied and click commit at the bottom of the page.

If you are using the local client-based workflow, clone your newly forked respository to your local machine (ie. computer). Open the entire top-level directory in Sublime Text 2. Open the programs directory, and right click (or ctrl-click on a Mac) on the programs directory and choose new folder. Name the folder with the name of your program/app (use dashes to link multiple words, rather than spaces). Then, right click on this new folder and choose new file. Copy all the contents from the `programs/boilerplate/scenario.md` file into here and save the file with the name `scenario.md` in the directory you just created with the name of your program/app.

From here, you can edit the `scenario.md` file to describe your program/app.

Each program/app must include:

*	a name for the program/app
*	a short, single sentence description
*	an illustrated narrative scenario (details below)
*	a diagram showing the relationship between objects (details below)
*	a collage to illustrate the experience
*	a collection of objects and the sensors/actuators/materials they will employ (details below)


### The Scenario

The scenario is the principal means by which you will simultaneously pitch your program/app and describe it's function, utility and the change in the use of space you expect as a result of it's installment. The scenario should be illustrated. You can do so with found images or by creating your own and uploading to the /images directory in your program/app directory. At minimum, the scenario must include:

*	a high level description of how the program/app will work
*	where the program/app fits along the programmatic spectrum
*	a list of the objects it will employ and any key sensors/actuators/materials they will use
*	a diagram of how the objects will be connected together

When you are finished, add your program/app to the wiki [Programs/App](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Programs-Apps) index page using the example there. Be sure to list the programmatic areas your app supports (eg. design, event, exhibition, etc).

Finally, submit a pull request for the site2site.github.io repository.



### The Object

Choose one of the objects that your program/app takes advantage of and complete the same process above for that object.

*	begin by using the boilerplate directory in the `objects` directory as your template
*	be sure to give your object a descriptive name
*	add your object to the [Object Index](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Object-Index) page of the wiki

Finally, submit a pull request for the site2site.github.io repository.



### The Sensor

Choose one of the sensors that your object takes advantage of and complete the same process above for that sensor.

*	begin by using the `boilerplate.md` file in the `sensor` directory as your template
*	be sure to give your sensor a descriptive name and name the file with that name (separating multiple words with dashes, not spaces)
*	add your sensor to the [Sensor Index](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Sensor-Index) page of the wiki

Finally, submit a pull request for the site2site.github.io repository.


### The Actuator

Choose one of the actuators that your object takes advantage of and complete the same process above for that actuator.

*	begin by using the `boilerplate.md` file in the `actuator` directory as your template
*	be sure to give your actuator a descriptive name and name the file with that name (separating multiple words with dashes, not spaces)
*	add your sensor to the [Actuator Index](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Actuator-Index) page of the wiki

Finally, submit a pull request for the site2site.github.io repository.



## Partner Critique

Each program/app scenario and contributions to the Object, Sensor and Actuator Index must be online by 11:59pm on Tuesday, September 10, 2013.

By noon on 11:59pm on Wednesday, September 11, 2013, each student must have offered comments to exactly - no more, no less - one other student, on their app. To organize this, first sign up on the [Programs/App](https://github.com/site2site/site2site.github.io/wiki/Programs-Apps) index of the wiki by putting your Github username next to someone else's project (see the example on the wiki). You can only sign up to critique someone that doesn't already have a critic, so each program/app will be critiqued.

Once the student you have signed up to crit has had their program/app merged with the master branch of the original repository, delete your local forked version of site2site.github.io. Then, fork it again.

Open their program/app `scenario.md` file and add a Critique section to the bottom with your comments. You will then issue a pull request.


## Code Academy

Next week, @rwaldron will be giving a workshop on programming in Javascript, and perhaps incorporating Node.js on the Raspberry Pi. If you have never programmed in Javascript before, please attempt the Javascript tutorial on [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn).
