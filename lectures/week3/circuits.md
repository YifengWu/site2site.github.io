## Electricity

### Electricity is the flow of electric charge.

### Current is read by convent to be flowing in the opposite direction of negatively charged electron flow.


## Measuring Electricity

### The flow of electrons through a conductor is fundamentallyl measured in terms of voltage (V), current (I) and resistance (R).

### Taking the Hoover dam as an analog, the voltage (V) is the potential energy force pushing on the dam.

### The current (I) is the speed at which the water flows through the dam and its turbines.

### The resistance (R) is in anything that limits the flow.



## Circuit

### A circuit is an closed system of electric charge flow.

### Circuits are described in symbolic notation.


## Ohm's Law

### Ohm's Law relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in a circuit.

## Resistance

### Resistors impede the flow of electric charge, converting the energy of flow into heat.

### Resistors are typically made of a resin-fixed mixture of carbon and ceramic, the ratio of which determines the amount of resistance, which is registered by a color coding system and measured in Ohms (&Omega;).

### Resistors are measured with either 4 or 5 bands.

*	![Five band resistor](http://guides.machinescience.org/file.php/29/QR/Resistor2.gif)

### The bands can be correlated to a value chart to determine the resistance.

## Test

### What is the resistance of each of these?

## Symbolic Notation

### In an electrical circuit, resistors are denoted with a wiggle.

## Resistors as Sensors

### Different types of resistors react to different elements of their environment, allowing them to serve as cheap sensors.

### A photoresistor changes its resistance depending on the amount of light it encounters.

### A thermistor changes its resistance depending on its surrounding temperature.
