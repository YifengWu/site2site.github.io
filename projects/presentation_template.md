## This is a section heading

### This is large text followed by a large image.

![Image](http://placehold.it/1280x600)

This is a small text caption to explain that the image above has been scaled to fit the page.

>	"This is a quote that will be red and italic."

## Another Section

### Here is some text introducing a series of images with a maximum width of 500px.

*	![Image 1](http://placehold.it/1280x900)
*	![Image 2](http://placehold.it/500x500)
*	![Image 3](http://placehold.it/300x450)
*	![Image 4](http://placehold.it/600x350)
*	![Image 5](http://placehold.it/1280x900)

Be sure to note that the images above are in a series because they are set up like bullet points, with an \* asterix before them.

### Below are some much smaller images if you want to group a whole bunch of them together.

*	__![Image 8](http://placehold.it/1280x900)__
*	__![Image 9](http://placehold.it/600x350)__
*	__![Image 10](http://placehold.it/500x500)__
*	__![Image 11](http://placehold.it/600x350)__
*	__![Image 12](http://placehold.it/300x450)__

The images above are set up like bullet points, and they are wrapped in double underscores, which will shrink them to a maximum size of 120px in height.

## Section NÂº3

### In Markdown you can insert regular HTML, so it's easy to, say, insert a video from Youtube.

<iframe width="1024" height="768" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_9TsrZ5iqwo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You should understand the video above like an image, it will be scaled to fit the page if you just insert the code.

### But, if you an \* and a tab infront of it, it will scale to a max-width of 500px.

*	<iframe width="1024" height="768" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_9TsrZ5iqwo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### I supposed you could also make a tiny video by wrapping it in underscores, like this:
