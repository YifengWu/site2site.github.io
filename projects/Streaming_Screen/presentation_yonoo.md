##  Concept

### Give the "language" back to designers in teleconferences.

Content sharing is crucial to remote collaboration, especially in brainstorm and group discussion. But nowadays, most of the teleconference systems are designed only to exchange information in voice and image. For designers, drawing and modeling are also the fundamental languages, which can be hardly communicated through microphone and camera. 

We will propose an app or system to let designers draw, annotate and modeling along with presentation in the teleconference. By connecting the handheld/laptop devices with the projector and the teleconference system, content on each device will be streamed onto the screen locally and remotely, which would make the conversation more efficient and accurate like that in a face-to-face meeting.


## Operation

### The system will base on many existing technology and software. But all of those will be reorganized into a compact interface. All

## Modeling on iPad

### Autodesk has developed several apps to support 3d modeling work on touch scree. The FormIt has already get the Ver 2.0.
